How can designers tap into one of the most creatively disruptive forces in the history of technology? And what accessibility innovations might disrupt the field of data visualization?",

He’ll then show examples of more “robust” decision trees from his new book, Practical Charts, that allow chart creators of any experience level to reliably make expert-level chart type choices.\n\"",

However, creating data sonifications with existing tools is difficult as authors have to figure out how to use music or raw audio software and switch between them. To make it easier to create sonifications and related applications, I introduce Erie, a JavaScript library for declaratively programming data sonifications. Erie supports encoding various auditory channels like time, pitch, tapping, and volume, and instruments like sine-wave oscillator, synth, and piano, which are customizable and extensible via audio filters and audio sampling. I show how Erie can support exploration of novel audio graph designs and development of customizable sonification applications.",

But that’s often where people go wrong because they do so in isolation of understanding the design task at hand. More than that, it’s just as easy to go beyond best practice and conventional advice. But to do so successfully requires a good understanding of the map’s purpose and its audience’s needs, as well as at least some understanding of how to design a map that works. It requires logic, careful choices, and a human touch. It demands a coherent strategy to help achieve a great map design whether you adhere to best practice or choose to make justifiable decisions and ignore it. This talk presents initial results of research that test common, and assumed cartographic practice, and explores how, and to what extent you can defy well-understood advice with solutions that work. It encourages positive disruption in map design through an appreciation of what are loosely called cartographic rules (best practices), and how they can be broken with success. It also introduces 'map doctor'; a new AI developed to help students and non-cartographers to get a critique on their maps. It helps identify what elements are working on the map, and can offer some options for solutions that might improve it.",

Valentina will discuss how she conquered the fear associated with the monumental task of creating over 200 infographics and the strategies she employed to effectively manage the workload. She will delve into the significance of data research in informing design decisions, the establishment of design boundaries to ensure consistency, and the inevitable compromises required to distill vast amounts of data into engaging, educational graphics tailored for a younger audience.\n\nA key focus of the talk will be on the psychological dimensions of creative work. Valentina will share stories that shed light on the fears and triumphs experienced, underlining the importance of flexibility, openness, and the value of a unique perspective in navigating the creative process with optimism.\n\nAttendees will leave with an appreciation of the complexities of researching, designing, and editing the encyclopedia, along with practical insights applicable to their own projects.\n\"",

Personas are polarizing and can overemphasize physical traits over deep mental models that inform businesses on how to really connect with leads.  \n\nOver the past 10 years, I have developed a roadmap to uncovering inclusive archetypal profiles and infographics to avoid \"\"profiling by demographics\"\". Building personality-based segmentation archetypes is a more memorable and inclusive way to bridge the gap between focusing on customer behaviors that drive business value. \n\nThis talk will reframe the persona narrative to focus on what really matters in strategic customer storytelling with custom crafted persona experiences.

This talk proposes expanding the boundaries of what is considered sonification, and how it can be done.\n\nIt does this by challenging existing conventions around what we can do with sonification, who gets to use sonification, why we sonify, what counts as valid data or valid sound, and the tools used to make sonifications. Alongside conventional sonification values such as insight and accuracy, we also value raw energy, expressiveness, polyphony, participation, decentralisation, performance, accessibility, approachability, community, and plurality of perspectives. \n\nThe approaches we describe do not seek to replace established methods, but to enrich them. We contribute a set of values, examples and instructions for joining this movement, and reflections on how people working beyond sonification might benefit from these ideas.\"",

We will look at projects such as Peter Eisenman’s “Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe”, Jer Thorp’s work on the “9/11 Memorial”, MASS Design Group’s “National Lynching Memorial”, as well as my own design for “Gedenkort Reichenau” – a memorial for a forced labor camp in my hometown of Innsbruck, Austria. One of the biggest challenges we faced with this project was the absence of a complete dataset to fully understand the crimes committed at the camp. Most administrative documents were destroyed just days before allied forces freed the camp, so we were left with incomplete data. I will talk about our approach we took to design the memorial that dealt with this fragmented memory.",

Through this innovative approach, the presentation seeks to inspire action and advocacy for social justice, challenging traditional data visualization methods and promoting a more empathetic and inclusive understanding of complex societal issues. By challenging conventional data visualization methods and emphasizing the importance of storytelling, the talk advocates for a more compassionate and inclusive approach to data analysis. Ultimately, it seeks to inspire action and advocacy for social change, empowering viewers to confront and address issues of gender bias and discrimination in healthcare practices.",
